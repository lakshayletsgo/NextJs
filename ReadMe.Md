## Hello This is Lakshay

##### Let's Us Start from what is nextjs and why we need it
Next.js is a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) applications. It allows developers to create fast, scalable, and maintainable web applications with a focus on performance and SEO.

Next Js is built on top of React and provides a lot of features out of the box such as server-side rendering

### How to setup a nextjs app
I will be working with file based routing mechanism and not with the app based routing as it is more complex and requires more setup.
To setup the app first you need to have node installed in your system.
Then you need to install the nextjs package using npm or yarn.

I have used yarn to install the packages so if you want to install yarn just use the command

```
npx install --global yarn
```

To create a next js app just run the command

```
yarn create next-app
```

If you want you can specify the name of the app after the next app then you have to do **no to app routing** to enable the file based routing mechanism.


#### Understanding the file structure
The file structure of a Next.js app is quite different from a traditional React app.
